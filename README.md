# SP3203 Bivalve Filtration Project

## Abstract
Microplastics (MP) are ubiquitous in the ocean. Marine vertebrates
and invertebrates, including bivalves, were shown to ingest MPs.
As emerging evidence suggests toxicity associated with human
consumption of MPs, there is an impetus to understand the
propensity of commercial bivalves to ingest and retain MPs. Here,
we subject the commercially valuable Meretrix meretrix and
Meretrix lusoria to laboratory MP exposure experiments. A large
number of replicates (n = 30 out of 48) did not show MP ingestion.
Our multiple regression model indicated the interaction between
shell length and species as a significant predictor explaining 11%
of the variance. Taken together, Meretrix spp. generally resist MP
ingestion but if the ingestion occurred, the rates were dependent
on size and species. These results can guide health authorities in
future directions for food safety
